K+
=====

A collection of user scripts for krautchan.net.

Features:
* Modularity - scripts can be installed independently from each other.
* Interoperability - no script in the repo should break others.
* cross-browser - Should work in Firefox+Greasemonkey, Chrome+Tampermonkey and Opera+Violentmonkey [1].

To be added once it makes sense:
* localization
* a module system

Not supported:
* chans that aren't KC.

[1] As soon as Opera at least [supports HTML documents in XHR2](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/xhr2/#xhrresponsetype).
